# Identicon

**A simple program written in Elixir that generates and saves an unique Identicon based off of your name. If you are into Elixir, give it a go.**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `identicon` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [

  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
